# String-Comparison-FuzzyWuzzy

## FuzzyWuzzy
Fuzzy string matching like a boss. It uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences in a simple-to-use package.

* Ratio: compares the entire string similarity, in order.
* Partial_ratio: compares partial string similarity.
* Token_sort_ratio: ignores word order.
* Token_set_ratio: ignores duplicated words. It is similar with token sort ratio, but a little bit more flexible.
